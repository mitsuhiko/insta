# Changelog

All notable changes to insta and cargo-insta are documented here.

## 1.40.0

- Added support for compact debug snapshots (`assert_compact_debug_snapshot`). #514

- Inline snapshots now use the required number of `#`s to escape the snapshot
  value, rather than always using `###`. This allows snapshotting values which
  themselves contain `###`. If there are no existing `#` characters in the
  snapshot value, a single `#` will be used.

- Print a warning when encountering old snapshot formats.  #503

- No longer suggest running `cargo insta` message when running `cargo insta test --check`.  #515

- Print a clearer error message when accepting a snapshot that was removed.  #516

- Fix `require-full-match` when running on inline snapshots outside of `cargo insta`.  #496

- Mark `require-full-match` as experimental, given some corner-cases are currently difficult to manage.  #497

- `cargo insta test` now accepts multiple `--exclude` flags.  #520

## 1.39.0

- Fixed a bug in `require_full_match`.  #485

- Fixed a bug that caused snapshot and module names to sometimes be inaccurate.  #483

- Insta will no longer error when removing snapshots that were already removed.  #484

- Added support for trailing commas in inline snapshots.  #472

- Don't pass `--color` in all cases to `libtest` any more to work around limitations
  with custom test harnesses.  #491

## 1.38.0

- `Filters` is now constructible from `IntoIterator`.  #400

- Change `std` macro calls to be fully qualified.  This fixes issues where
  the prelude was not used or the macros were overridden.  #469

## 1.37.0

- All macros for file snapshots should now handle trailing commas (but not yet inline snapshots)

- Vendored old `yaml-rust` dependency to avoid rustsec warnings.  #465

## 1.36.1

- Fix an ownership issue introduced in 1.36 with snapshot assertions.  #453

## 1.36.0

- Deprecate `INSTA_FORCE_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS` env-var for `INSTA_FORCE_UPDATE`.
  The latter was documented, the former was implemented.  #449

- Add `require_full_match` option.  #448

- Deprecate `assert_display_snapshot!`.  #385

## 1.35.1

- Fixed a bug with diffs showing bogus newlines.

## 1.35.0

- Fixed a crash when a file named `.config` was in the root.
- Added new alternative `match .. { ... }` syntax to redactions for better
  `rustfmt` support.  (#428)
- The `--package` parameter can be supplied multiple times now.  (#427)
- Leading newlines in snapshots are now ignored to resolve issues with
  inline snapshots that were never able to match.  (#444)
- `cargo insta test` now accepts the `--test` parameter multiple times.  (#437)

## 1.34.0

- Snapshots are now sorted in the UI on review.  (#413)

- Fixed handling of `--manifest-path` with regards to virtual workspaces.  (#409)

## 1.33.0

- Added `--all-targets` parameter support to `cargo insta test`.  (#408)

## 1.32.0

- Added `--profile` parameter support to `cargo insta test`.

## 1.31.0

- Fixed a bug that caused `cargo insta test` not to report test failures.
- Suppress `needless_raw_string_hashes` clippy lint on inline snapshots.  (#390)

## 1.30.0

- Resolved a bug on Windows that caused `input_file` not to be written into the
  snapshots.  (#386)
- Snapshots are accepted when running with `--accept` even if a test outside
  insta fails.  (#358)
- Mark settings drop guard as `#[must_use]`.
- Write inline snapshots with atomic rename to avoid some rare races.  (#373)
- Pass `--color=...` to libtest to propagate color choices in more situations.  (#375)

## 1.29.0

- Fixed a rendering bug with snapshot display (lines were not
  rendered to the terminal width).
- Added `--exclude` option to `cargo insta test`. (#360)
- Inherit `color` option from a `CARGO_TERM_COLOR` environment variable (#361)

## 1.28.0

- Added `allow_duplicates!` to enable multiple assertions for a
  single snapshot. (#346)
- Ensure that expressions formatted with `rustfmt` use unix newlines.
- Added a way to disable diffing in review. (#348)
- Added three argument version of `glob!` to set a different base
  path. (#347)
- Added `rounded_redaction` to truncate floating point values. (#350)

## 1.27.0

- Fix an issue where the inline snapshot patcher could panic in
  certain situations. (#341)
- `cargo insta test` now correctly detects CI environments like
  `cargo test` does. In that case it will by fail rather than
  create snapshot update files. (#345)
- Added `cargo insta test --check` to force check runs. (#345)

## 1.26.0

- Make canonicalization in `glob!` optional to better support WASI.

## 1.25.0

- Added a way to disable the undiscoverable snapshots warning. By
  setting the `review.warn_undiscovered` config key to `false` a
  warning is never printed. (#334)
- Force updating snapshots will now not overwrite files that did not
  change. This improves the behavior for situations if that behavior
  is preferred as a default choice. (#335)

## 1.24.1

- Fix non working `--include-hidden` flag (#331)
- Fix incorrect mapping of `review.include_ignored` (#330)

## 1.24.0

- Added an insta tool config (`.config/insta.yaml`) to change the
  behavior of insta and cargo-insta. (#322)
- Renamed `--no-ignore` to `--include-ignored`.
- Added `--include-hidden` to instruct insta to also walk into
  hidden paths.
- Added new `--unreferenced` option to `cargo-insta test` which allows
  fine tuning of what should happen with unreferenced files. It's now
  possible to ignore (default), warn, reject or delete unreferenced
  snapshots. (#328)
- Resolved an error message about doc tests when using nextest with
  test targeting. (#317)

## 1.23.0

- Add a hint if snapshots might be skipped. (#314)
- Avoid extra newline in YAML snapshots. (#311)

## 1.22.0

- Added support for rendering some invisibles in diffs. This now also
  should make sure that ANSI sequences in strings are no longer screwing
  up the terminal output. (#308)
- Prevent inline snapshots to be used in loops. (#307)
- Support the `--target` option to `cargo insta test`. (#309)
- Globbing now adds directories as disambiguators into the snapshot
  suffixes. This allows patterns such as `foo/*/*.txt` without
  creating conflicts. (#310)

## 1.21.2

- Added missing parameters to `cargo insta test`. (#305)
- Fixed a sorting issue in hash maps for compound keys. (#304)

## 1.21.1

- Fix incorrect handling of extra args to `cargo insta test`.

## 1.21.0

- Fixed an issue that broke support for older rust versions. (#292)
- Added `cargo insta show` command to render a snapshot.
- Added support for compact JSON snapshots. (#288)

## 1.20.0

- `cargo insta` now supports nextest as test runner. (#285)
- The `glob!` macro now defers failures by default. (#284)

## 1.19.1

- Added support for numeric keys in JSON which regressed in 0.18.0. (#281)

## 1.19.0

- Removed `backtrace` feature.
- Removed `serialization` feature.
- `assert_json_snapshot!` and `assert_yaml_snapshot!` now require
  the `json` and `yaml` feature respectively.
- Doctests now emit a warning that inline snapshot updating is
  not supported (#272)
- Added support for `INSTA_GLOB_FILTER` to skip over tests expanded
  from a glob. (#274)

## 1.18.2

- Avoid the use of `#[allow(unused)]` in the macro. (#271)

## 1.18.1

- Fixed a regression in the JSON serialization format with newtypes and
  tuple variants. (#270)

## 1.18.0

- `Settings::bind` now can return a result.
- Expose the drop guard type of `bind_to_scope`.
- The `serde` dependency is now optional. While still enabled by default
  users need to opt into `yaml` and `json` features explicitly to regain
  support for it. To avoid the default `serde` dependency the default
  features just need to be disabled. (#255)
- Deprecated unused `serialization` features.
- Deprecated unused `backtrace` feature.
- Removed deprecated `Settings::bind_to_thread`.

**Breaking Changes / Upgrading:** If you are upgrading to serde 1.18.0 you will
receive deprecating warnings if you are using the `assert_yaml_snapshot!` and
`assert_json_snapshot!` macros. These macros will continue to function in the
future but they will require explicit opting into the `yaml` and `json` features.
To silence the warning add them to your `insta` dependency. Additionally the
`backtrace` feature was deprecated. It is no longer needed so just remove it.

## 1.17.2

- Remove an accidentally debug print output.

## 1.17.1

- Added support for nextest. (#242)
- Resolved an issue where inline snapshot tests in doctests refused to
  work. (#252)

## 1.17.0

- Fixed an issue in `cargo-insta` where sometimes accepting inline snapshots
  would crash with an out of bounds panic.
- Added new `filters` feature. (#245)
- Disallow unnamed snapshots in doctests. (#246)
- `with_settings!` macro now inherits the former settings rather than resetting. (#249)
- Added support for `Settings::bind_to_scope` and deprecated
  `Settings::bind_to_thread`. (#250)
- Added support for `minimal-versions` builds.

## 1.16.0

- Added `--no-quiet`/`-Q` flag to `cargo insta test` to suppress the
  quiet flag. This works around limitations with custom test harnesses
  such as cucumber.
- Update RON to 0.7.1.
- Improved ergonomics around `with_settings!`. It's now a perfect match to
  the settings object's setter methods.
- Added `description` and `info` to snapshots. (#239)
- Added `omit_expression` setting. (#239)
- Added improved support for running insta from doctests. (#243)

## 1.15.0

- Bump minimum version of Rust to 1.56.1. This was done because the used
  serde-yaml dependency no longer supports older versions of Rust.

## 1.14.1

- Update uuid crate to 1.0.0. (#228)
- Use inline block format also for strings of form `"foo\n"`. (#225)

## 1.14.0

- Fixed a bug that caused insta to panic if inline snapshot assertions
  moved since the time of the snapshot creation. (#220)
- `cargo insta test` now returns non zero status code when snapshots
  are left for review. (#222)
- Assertion failures now mention `cargo insta test`. (#223)

## 1.13.0

- Fixed a bug where an extra newline was emitted following the snapshot header.
- `assertion_line` is no longer retained in snapshots. (#218)

## 1.12.0

- Add support for sorting redactions (`sorted_redaction` and `Settings::sort_selector`). (#212)
- Changed snapshot name detection to no longer use thread names but function names. (#213)

**Upgrade Notes:**

Insta used to detect the current test name by using the current thread name. This
appeared to work well but unfortunately ran into various limitations. In particular
in some cases the thread name was truncated, missing or did not point to the current
test name. To better support different platforms and situations insta now uses the
function name instead.

This however changes behavior. In particular if you are using a helper function to
assert, a different snapshot name will now be used. You can work around this issue
by using a helper macro instead or to explicitly pass a snapshot name in such
situations.

## 1.11.0

  will quickly be old, they are often useful when reviewing snapshots
  immediately after creation with `cargo-insta`. (#191)

## 1.7.2

- Fixed an issue where selectors could not start with underscore. (#189)
- Allow passing arguments to `cargo test`. (#183)
- Avoid the use of `Box::leak`. (#185)

  directory rather than whatever `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` was set to at compile
  time. (#180)

    $ cargo install cargo-insta
    $ fastmod '\bassert_([a-z]+_snapshot)_matches!' 'assert_${`}!' -e rs --accept-all
    $ cargo insta test --all --force-update-snapshots --accept
